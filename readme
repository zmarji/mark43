NOTES:
didnt really get that much time to work on this since tuesday so wanted to point a few things out

1- I figured we discussed how we would do this on the low level using hashes and regex when we talked  on tuesday so I used a powerful language processing tool to handle the work espcially for the tokanization part check out http://www.nltk.org/

2- the format you post the json is in the URL i realize this isnt the best approach but that was done for the sake of speed

3- I wanted to add some tests to this or even start it from scrach using TDD, again time was a factor. 

4- Was going to attempt to do it using elasticsearch but figuring out the tokenizers would have been a bit time consuming (mainly things like tokenizing a sentence or aggregations) I will be trying that on my own so if you want email me and I'll give you some new end points that use ES as the backbone.

this is running on ubuntu aws micro instance that i created for this purpose, please let me know when you're done checking this out so i can terminate it (i miss getting free service but I'm far past that now)
